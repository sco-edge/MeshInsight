Thatâ€™s because the install script is pushing/installing an obsolete version of docker-compose and the system gets confused because docker ships with an updated version of it by default
I was able to fix it from my side by doing

pip remove docker-compose
apt reinstall docker-compose-plugin
curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash -s -- --no-install-docker --no-install-compose
